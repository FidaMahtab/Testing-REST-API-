# Testing-REST-API-
Testing REST API of an Employee Management System, built in Java spring boot and ReactJS
<h3>Create API </h3>
Findings: 

If we post one extra column like “address” that will declare as an error, and it says “bad request” 

If we omit one column like “lastName” that will show us an error named “Internal Server Error”
